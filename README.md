# Scanty, a really small blog

## Overview

Original [scanty
readme](https://github.com/chischaschos/scanty/blob/master/README.rdoc), but a
few changes:

- Simplified views and coverted them to HAML
- Added specs and fixed test suite
- Updated gems
- Added sprockets
- Added [foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)

Made some changes to the default code base in
order to remove empty spaces, fix test suite, upgrade used gems and
customize its configuration.

## Priority fixes

- Generated markup styles
- Decoupling post model business logic

## Just for fun roadmap:

- Be able to post/fix older posts
- Syntaxis highlight for different languages
- Post review history
- Responsive layouts
- Try to improve code so that codeclimate becomes happier [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/badge.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/chischaschos/scanty)
