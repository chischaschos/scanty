# Scanty, a really small blog

## Overview

Keeps same features as mentioned in the original [scanty
readme](https://github.com/chischaschos/scanty/blob/master/README.rdoc). Made some changes to the default code base in
order to remove empty spaces, fix test suite, upgrade used gems and
customize its configuration.

## Just for fun roadmap:

- Update gems
- Implement integration tests
- Haml views
- Syntaxis highlight for different languages
- Post review history
- Responsive layouts
- Try to improve code so that codeclimate becomes happier [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/badge.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/chischaschos/scanty)
